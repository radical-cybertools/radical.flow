class RadicalExecutionBackend(BaseExecutionBackend):
    """
    The RadicalExecutionBackend class is responsible for managing computing resources
    and creating sessions for executing tasks on a large scale. It interfaces with
    different resource management systems such SLURM and FLUX on diverse HPC machines.
    This backend is capable of initialize sessions, manage task execution, and submit
    resources required for the workflow.

    Attributes:
        session (rp.Session): A session instance used to manage and track task execution,
            uniquely identified by a generated ID. This session serves as the primary context for
            all task and resource management within the workflow.

        task_manager (rp.TaskManager): Manages the lifecycle of tasks, handling their submission,
            tracking, and completion within the session.

        pilot_manager (rp.PilotManager): Manages computing resources, known as "pilots," which
            are dynamically allocated based on the provided resources. The pilot manager
            coordinates these resources to support task execution.

        resource_pilot (rp.Pilot): Represents the submitted computing resources as a pilot.
            This pilot is described by the `resources` parameter provided during initialization,
            specifying details such as CPU, GPU, and memory requirements.

    Parameters:
        resources (Dict): A dictionary specifying the resource requirements for the pilot,
            including details like the number of CPUs, GPUs, and memory. This dictionary
            configures the pilot to match the needs of the tasks that will be executed.

    Raises:
        Exception: If session creation, pilot submission, or task manager setup fails,
            the RadicalExecutionBackend will raise an exception, ensuring the resources
            are correctly allocated and managed.

    Example:
        ```python
        resources = {"cpu": 4, "gpu": 1, "memory": "8GB"}
        backend = RadicalExecutionBackend(resources)
        ```
